## Ongoing Project

- Pathological Symptoms and Underlying Mechanisms of G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Deficiency in Alzheimer's Disease 

- This study aims to uncover the link between a pattern recognition receptor (PRPS) and Alzheimer’s disease, with a focus on the role of neuroinflammation in AD and identifying potential therapeutic targets. A series of experiments, including behavioral tests, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and real-time PCR, are conducted using special gene-knockout mice. Additionally, mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis are employed to investigate the impact of gene knockout on the expression and signaling pathways of related genes, further exploring the underlying cellular mechanisms.

## Early Project

- Preparation and Performance Evaluation of Flame-Retardant Lignin-Based Aerogels

- This projext utilized sodium lignosulfonate as the raw material, with sodium alginate and phytic acid serving as both flame retardants and crosslinking agents. Using a sol-gel method and freeze-drying technology, a flame-retardant lignin-based aerogel material was successfully prepared. Various characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), universal testing machine, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermal conductivity meter, vertical burning tester, and oxygen index tester, were employed to investigate the aerogel's morphology, mechanical properties, thermal insulation performance, thermal stability, and flame retardancy.
